# 1. Debugging Logic
"The game sometimes doesn’t start when clicking the Start button. 
Help me debug the script step-by-step — check event listeners, 
hidden class toggling, and console errors to ensure the game initializes correctly."

# 2. Audio Troubleshooting
"The Web Audio sounds don’t play unless I refresh or click twice. 
Explain how to unlock audio contexts safely on Safari and Chrome. 
Make sure sound effects play instantly on the first user action."

# 3. Visual Contrast Issues
"The result modal has low contrast on dark backgrounds. 
Give me CSS fixes to increase contrast, improve readability, and make it more accessible. 
Prefer darker backgrounds and bright text with subtle glow effects."

# 4. Responsiveness Testing
"Make sure the layout scales cleanly from 1080p desktops down to small mobile screens.
The grid should reflow from 4x3 to 2x6 smoothly. Add CSS breakpoints and 
ensure the text and buttons stay centered even in narrow viewports."

# 5. Accessibility Enhancements
"Add ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation for the game grid so users can
flip cards using Enter/Space and hear updates via aria-live labels."

# 6. Smooth Transitions
"Make the card flip animations smoother — use `transform-style: preserve-3d`
and a `.35s` transition on `.inner`. Add a pulse or scale-up effect on matches."

# 7. Data Persistence
"Implement localStorage tracking for the best time and show it in the result modal.
If localStorage isn’t available, skip gracefully without throwing an error."

# 8. Code Simplification
"Refactor the flip and match logic to be simpler and avoid race conditions.
Combine lockBoard, flipped, and matched checks into a small finite state flow."

# 9. Offline Stability
"Ensure all assets (SVGs, audio) work offline. 
Replace CDN audio links with Web Audio API tones that generate locally."

# 10. Polish UI Feedback
"Add a light success vibration or a quick visual pulse when the player makes a match. 
If `navigator.vibrate()` exists, trigger [20, 30, 20] on matches."

# 11. Modal & Restart Flow
"When a player wins and clicks 'Play Again', 
the modal should close, reset state, rebuild deck, and restart timer without refreshing the page."

# 12. Share Button Enhancement
"Improve the Share Score button. 
If Web Share API is available, use it to post to mobile share sheets; 
otherwise, copy text to clipboard and show 'Copied!' feedback for 1 second."

# 13. Game Feel Improvements
"Give me quick tweaks to make the game more satisfying:
shorter flip delay, snappy audio feedback, 
and slightly faster animations for smooth replayability."

# 14. Performance Optimization
"Optimize the grid rendering for low-end devices: 
minimize repainting, use will-change: transform on cards, 
and batch DOM updates to prevent frame drops."

# 15. Final QA Checklist
"Create a simple QA checklist for this web game:
✓ Start and Restart buttons work
✓ Sounds play after one click
✓ Grid builds correctly
✓ Matches increment score
✓ Timer resets properly
✓ Modal appears on win
✓ Best score saves"
