# 1. Theme & Purpose
"Suggest game concepts that address social challenges relevant to young people in Australia or Vietnam.
The game must be playable in under 5 minutes, browser-only, and raise awareness about topics like
mental health, social inclusion, sustainability, or community wellbeing."

# 2. Choosing the Issue
"I want something light-hearted but still meaningful. Which social issue could fit a fun web game
that also educates the player indirectly? Suggest a few options that mix humor with learning outcomes."

# 3. Brainstorming Game Formats
"Give me short game concepts based on board, card, or dice mechanics that could work in 2D with HTML/CSS/JS only.
Each should connect the theme (like stress, climate, or equality) directly to gameplay — not just visuals.
Examples: matching pairs, rolling for events, decision-based paths, trivia with moral outcomes."

# 4. Idea Refinement
"I like the idea of matching stress triggers with healthy coping actions.
Expand that into a playable matching game that feels like a meme (‘Exam Arc vs Hydration Buff’) but still shares real mental-health tips."

# 5. Player Motivation
"How can I keep the game engaging for players under 3 minutes?
Suggest a short feedback loop, scoring system, or rank mechanic (like 'Sigma Ascendant' or 'Zen Speedrun') 
to make players want to replay and beat their previous best time."

# 6. Educational Integration
"Propose ways to include meaningful wellbeing information (hydration, journaling, rest, sunlight, etc.)
without interrupting gameplay. Keep it lightweight — maybe show tips after each win or in a results summary."

# 7. Tone and Style
"Describe the visual and tonal style for a Gen Z audience — something that feels like a meme,
uses emojis, pop language (‘rizz’, ‘NPC’, etc.), but still lands the message of self-awareness and balance."

# 8. Replayability
"Suggest simple randomization mechanics so each playthrough feels different:
e.g., shuffle pairs, randomize card order, or mix new stress/cope pairs per round."

# 9. Social Connection
"How can I add small social-sharing features so players can show their result
('I achieved Based & Focused rank in Mind Match!') without external accounts or databases?"

# 10. AI Involvement
"Outline how an LLM could assist in building this project end-to-end —
concept brainstorming, generating stress/cope pair text, creating SVG art, coding logic, and writing copy for the UI."
