# 1. Card Design Variations
"Generate flat 2D card illustrations that look minimal yet expressive. 
Each card should include an emoji or simple symbol (e.g., üíÄ for stress, ‚òÄÔ∏è for calm) 
on a soft gradient background. Maintain rounded corners and use subtle drop shadows."

# 2. Background Theme
"Create a looping background gradient for the main game screen that transitions 
from a calm mint-teal (#7ff7c8) to a deep navy (#0e1427). 
It should feel relaxing and modern, with slight movement or parallax effect if possible."

# 3. Audio / SFX Prompts
"Suggest sound effect concepts for flipping cards, matching pairs, and winning. 
Each should be short (under 0.5s), punchy, and upbeat ‚Äî something like a click, chime, or pop.
Describe how to reproduce them using Web Audio API without external audio files."

# 4. Typography & UI Style
"Recommend web fonts and styles for a Gen Z audience. 
Title font should be pixel or retro-gaming style (like 'Press Start 2P'), 
while body text should use a clean sans-serif (like 'Poppins'). 
Keep accessibility in mind ‚Äî ensure text contrast is at least 4.5:1."

# 5. Modal & Icon Aesthetic
"Design a high-contrast pop-up modal to celebrate a win. 
It should have a glowing border, soft neon blues or purples, 
and icons for 'Play Again' and 'Share Score'. 
Make the overall look resemble a polished game overlay."

# 6. Visual Consistency
"Create a color palette system for two card categories:
  - Stress Cards: gradients of warm red, coral, and magenta
  - Coping Cards: gradients of mint, teal, and blue-green
Ensure both contrast well and remain readable for color-blind users."

# 7. Loading Animation
"Generate a minimalist loading animation using CSS only ‚Äî 
for example, 3 bouncing dots or a rotating brain icon üß†.
It should match the same color theme as the cards."

# 8. Ambient Effect Prompt
"Describe how to use subtle CSS blur or opacity overlays to 
simulate a 'fog of stress' on the board background that clears 
slightly each time the player matches a pair ‚Äî symbolizing progress."

# 9. Badge System
"Design small achievement badges for milestones like:
  - 'Focus Buff' for completing under 1 minute
  - 'Mind Gym Member' for 3 wins in a row
  - 'Zen Speedrun' for a perfect game (no mismatches)
Each badge should fit in a 64x64px rounded-square frame."

# 10. Accessibility Icons
"Suggest a simple icon set (SVG or emoji) for UI elements:
  - Sound On/Off
  - Restart
  - Menu
  - Time
  - Score
Make them minimalist, outline style, and consistent with modern web UI."
